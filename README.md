# The Honk Generator

## Motivation

Are you wondering if you can talk only using honks with your friends? Are you pretending to be a goose in a social media group? Are you looking for something impractical and not useful in any way?

**Then this generator is for you!**

## How does it Work

It simply uses <a href="https://github.com/ozdemirburak/morsify">Morsify</a> to convert honks to Morse Codes to plain text.<br>
**"Honk"** refers to dots (.),<br>
**"Hoonk" (with 2 'o's)** refers to dashes (-),<br>
**"Hooonk" (with 3 'o's)** refers to space to separate between parsed characters.
